🟢 1. MongoDB — The Database
-------------------------------
Think of MongoDB as:
🧺 A big storage room where your app’s data lives permanently.

It is a NoSQL database — instead of tables (like MySQL), it stores data in documents (JSON format).

Example data inside MongoDB:

{
  "_id": "6715f28b82d6",
  "name": "Biswojit",
  "email": "biswojit@gmail.com",
  "age": 23
}

🧠 What MongoDB does:
Stores data
Organizes data in collection
Supports queries (find, insert, update, delete)
Handles indexing, performance, replication, backups
It’s the engine of your data.

2. Prisma — The Data Access Layer (ORM)
----------------------------------------
Think of Prisma as:
🧑‍💻 A smart assistant that talks to MongoDB for you — cleanly, safely, and with TypeScript support.

It’s not a database.

It’s an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) → in simple terms, a tool to make database work easier in your backend code.

Instead of writing raw queries like:

db.users.find({ name: "Biswojit" })

You write:

const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { name: "Biswojit" }
});

✨ What Prisma gives you:
Auto-generated TypeScript types (super useful for bigger apps).
Schema-based modeling (easy to maintain and change).
Clean and structured queries.
Middleware support (e.g., logging, auth checks).
Easier migrations / schema evolution.
Works with multiple databases — MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.


2. Winston:-
-------------
- It is the actual logger engine

3. winston-rotate-file:-
--------------------------
-We use it to write logs to files that rotate by date.

4. nest-winston:-
-------------------
-Used to connect Winston into NestJS so Nest's logging goes through Winston.

Order of caling exception filters:-
Nest calls them in order:
1. Prisma filter
2. Mongo filter
3. AllExceptions filter
